## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this Challange I encountered so many new things in **CSS** and **HTML**, which I learned all about **Responsive** Design and **MObile-First** Design. Finally I saw a lot of improvments in my **HTML** and **CSS** skill.


```html
<h1>Equilibrium #3429</h1>
```
```css
body {
  background-color: hsl(217, 54%, 11%);
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I really want to improve this project using **JavaScript**.


### Useful resources

- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_image_overlay_opacity) - This helped me on how opacity and hovering properties work. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
